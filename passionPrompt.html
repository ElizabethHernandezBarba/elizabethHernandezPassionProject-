       <h3> Learning Languages And Cultures </h3>
    
        <p> I’m passionate about learning languages and the cultures that come from them. I believe learning a language takes time and effort but it is very rewarding when speaking to natives and making friends in the process. I grew up listening to Spanish since my parents only spoke that language. Once I began school  I learned English and I began showing interest in learning more languages at around age 8 when my 3rd-grade teacher would show her love for France and would teach us basic french throughout the year. I loved learning French and French culture. I remember that I would go home and practice my french instead of playing outside. It was more fun for me to practice and see my growth. Sadly after 3rd grade, I stopped my studies since I had no more resources and I forgot about it. In middle school, I took a french lesson and I started to learn it again having to start over.
 
    At the end of middle school, I took a liking to Japan and learned some Japanese words. In high school, I took two years of French class and I am continuing to learn with online resources and books. I have been learning Japanese for two years as well and this year I began talking to native Japanese speakers to advance my Japanese. I have made awesome friends because of our love for languages and cultures. Languages are not easy to learn but just trying is enough and I hope to learn even more languages and travel the world in the future.
